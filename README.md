# Smarter Workbench

A react.js app built from SmarterChat, an npm component. This project contains the source code for the interactive chatbot found in the Smarter web console [developer workbench](https://platform.smarter.sh/chatbots/example/). This is a working example of how to integrate SmarterChat into
existing web pages; in this case, a Django project. See [Smarter Technical Overview](./doc/README.md)

![Basic Usage](./doc/img/readme-usage4.png)

## Usage: integrate to an existing Django web application

Pass an authenticated chatbot api url that works with any chatbot associated with your Smarter account, regardless of whether it has been deployed.

Implementation example:

```js
// THIS REPO:
// 1. set this value in './src/shared/constants'
export const CDN_HOST_BASE_URL = "https://cdn.platform.smarter.sh/";
```

```html
<!-- YOUR EXISTING WEB PAGE: -->
<!-- 2. add a react 'root' element to your DOM that react can locate and initialize itself.  -->
<div
  id="root"
  smarter-chatbot-api-url="https://my-ai-agent.1234-5678-9012.platform.smarter.sh/"
  smarter-toggle-metadata="false"
></div>

<!-- 3. add a script element pointing to the `app-loader.js` found in the build artifacts -->
<script src="https://cdn.platform.smarter.sh/ui-chat/app-loader.js"></script>
```

```console
# build and deploy your solution. Requires awscli + keypair with sufficient permissions.
make release
```

where:

- `smarter-chatbot-api-url`: a Smarter chatbot api url
- `smarter-toggle-metadata`: true if additional chat meta data should appear in the chat thread
- `app-loader.js` is a helper script that inserts the current latest react app build assets into the DOM. For the avoidance of any doubt, you
  could also just add the literal css and js file links to the DOM yourself. However, react app build assets are hashed, meaning that if you take
  this approach then you will need to edit your existing web page to resync the new hashed files each time you republish this react app.

## Developers

SmarterChat is created with [React](https://react.dev/) leveraging [@chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react)

### Backend integration

See [Getting Started with the Smarter Chatbot Api](./doc/CHATBOT_API.md)
This app interacts with two endpoints from the [smarter.sh/v1](https://platform.smarter.sh/docs/api/) chatbot api:

- GET `/config/`: retrieves a json dict, structured in 4 major sections, with all information required by the react app.
- POST `/chat/`: send a text completion prompt to the Smarter Api.

Smarter chatbot urls use either of these three naming conventions:

- public: `https://<str:name>.<str:account_number>.example.com/`
- authenticated: `https://platform.smarter.sh/chatbots/<str:name>/`. This react component looks for and adds the Smarter platform sessionid cookie value to request headers, if it exists.
- authenticated api: `https://platform.smarter.sh/api/v1/chatbots/<int:chatbot_id>/`

Public api url examples for a deployed chatbot:

- `https://my-chatbot.3141-5926-5359.api.smarter.sh/`

Authenticated api url example for any chatbot in your Smarter account:

- `https://platform.smarter.sh/chatbots/my-chatbot/`
- `https://platform.smarter.sh/api/v1/chatbots/5/`

#### Config

A Json dict containing all configuration data for the chatbot. This is downloaded at run-time when the reactapp is initializing.
Example: [/chatbots/example/config/?session_key=YOUR-SESSION-KEY](http://localhost:8000/chatbots/example/config/)

See: [sample config](./data/sample-config.json)

#### Api

A REST Api for sending and receiving chat prompt requests. The url comes from the config dict (above): data.chatbot.url_chatbot.
example: `http://api.smarter.sh/v1/chatbots/smarter/example/`

example http request:

```json
{
    "method": "POST",
    "credentials": "include",
    "mode": "cors",
    "headers": {
        "Accept": "application/json",
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        "X-CSRFToken": "q9WXqqIhYJMI3ZSBIOE18JMORBMqAHri",

    },
    "body": "{\"session_key\":\"a07593ecfaecd24008ca4251096732663ac0213b8cc6bdcce4f4c043276ab0b5\",\"messages\":[{\"role\":\"system\",\"content\":\"You are a helpful chatbot."},{\"role\":\"assistant\",\"content\":\"Welcome to the Smarter demo!\"}]}"
}
```

example http response:

```json

  "data": {
    "isBase64Encoded": false,
    "statusCode": 200,
    "headers": {
      "Content-Type": "application/json"

## Contributor Reference

### Getting Started

- `make`: prints a full menu of commands to the console.
- `make init`: Setup your environment for first time use. sets up your Node environment for you. initializes pre-commit, which you need to run prior to creating pull requests.
- `make run`: Run the dev server locally
- `make build`: Build the react.js project. saves vite.js output to `./build` in the root of this project.
- `make release`: Deploy the react.js project. **REQUIRES awscli + keypair with sufficient permissions**. Publishes the contents of the `./build` folder to an AWS S3 bucket served by the host defined by the value of `CDN_HOST_BASE_URL` located in shared/constant.js. For example, the react app for the Smarter workbench is initialized and served from these endpoints: a. [index.html](https://cdn.platform.smarter.sh/ui-chat/index.html): the react app build artifacts, and b. [app-loader.js](https://cdn.platform.smarter.sh/ui-chat/app-loader.js): a script to insert the react app build artifacts into the DOM.

### Hello world app

Note that `make build` also generates a simple '[hello-world.html](https://cdn.platform.smarter.sh/ui-chat/hello-world.html)' app that demonstrates how to integrate Smarter Chat to an existing web page.

### Architecture

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- [React](https://react.dev/)
- [Chat UI Kit React](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@chatscope/chat-ui-kit-react)
